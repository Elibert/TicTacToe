# TicTacToe

This is a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game. But the key difference from the traditional Tic Tac Toe game is that you need to have football knowledge in order to succeed in the game. So let's explain what does this mean.
In a normal Tic Tac Toe game you can put a X or O on any empty square, but in this game you also need to find a football player that has played for both clubs that are intersected in that specific square. You can play this game with your friend, each of you from your own device. You just need to create the game and share the game code with your friend, and you both get connected together to the same gameroom. After the players get connected, the clubs are chosen randomly by the system. If both of the players struggle to play with the chosen clubs and find it too difficult, they can choose to change the clubs and the round will be restared. Players' turns are timed so you need to think fast if you want to win. First to win 3 rounds wins the game.
